# Investigating-gradient-vanishing-and-CNN-accuracy-improving

In the first part of the work, it was analyzed the appearance of gradient vanishing with sigmoid activation functions. Correspondingly, methods were proposed to solve this issue.

In the second part of the work, the purpose was to improve validation accuracy of CNN (without overfitting) more than 75%. Solution was enlarging the training dataset with data augmentation technique.
