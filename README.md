# Investigating-gradient-vanishing-and-CNN-accuracy-improving

In the first part of the work, it was analyzed the appearance of gradient vanishing with sigmoid activation functions. Solution was implementing the cross-entropy cost function and optimizing the model.

In the second part of the work, the purpose was to improve validation accuracy of CNN (without overfitting) more than 75%. Solution was enlarging the training dataset with data augmentation technique.
